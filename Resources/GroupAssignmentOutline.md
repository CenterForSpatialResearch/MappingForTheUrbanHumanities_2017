###Designing Assignments and Methods

Over the course of Week Two you will work in your groups/pairs to take the research question(s) and datasets you identified in Week One and develop a "prototype" of your course assignment or research agenda. On Friday each group/pair will give a short presention about their "prototype" and the process of making it.

The goal here is to apply some of the concepts and methods you have learned in the past two weeks to your group's topic. 

These group presentations will open onto a structured conversation about the kinds of new methodological and pedagogical approaches spatial thinking might allow, as well as the challenges often present when embarking on a mapping project on your own. 

#### Prototype Requirements

The form of your prototype should speak to the concerns of your group's topic and must include at least one map (static or web based).

The requirements for these "prototypes" are purposefully broad. Feel free to draw on the methods and concepts covered in course tutorials, the course bibliography, examples from the geohumanities as inspiration. 

If you are designing an assignment your prototype might include:
* the description of your assignment
* data cleaned for your students
* some draft maps that are examples of what you would like you students to produce

If you are desinging a research project your prototype might include:
* an outline of a research methodology
* some preliminary analytical or descriptive maps
* a list of further data sets you need to find or produce


#### Presentations 

If you are designing a course assignment some questions you might choose address in your presentation are: 

* What is/are the spatial question(s) you are asking your students to answer?
* What are the learning objectives for an assignment aimed at answering those questions? 
* What datasets will your students draw on to answer those questions?
* What methods will your students need to employ to answer those questions? 
* What deliverables will you ask your students to produce? 
* How will you assess student work and learning outcomes? 

If you are designing a research project some questions you might choose address in your presentation are: 
* What is your spatial research question? 
* What datasets will you draw on to answer that question?
* What analytical methods will you need to use to address this question?
* What new methods will you need to learn? 
* What will the final form of your research be? 
* What are the major


#### Outline

On *Tuesday, May 30*: Decide with your group a general direction for your "prototype."
Between Tuesday and Wednesday research examples/predecents that can help guide your group's work on the prototype. 

On both *Wednesday* and *Thursday* you will have 1 hour to work with your group and the course instructors to develop your prototype. 

On *Friday, June 2* you will have 2.5 hours to work with your group and the course instructors to finalize your prototype and presentation. The final 2 hours of class will be dedicated to group presentations and a discussion of the work.
