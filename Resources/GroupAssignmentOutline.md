### Designing Assignments and Methods

Over the course of Week Two you will work in your groups/pairs to take the research question(s) and datasets you identified in Week One and develop a draft of your course assignment or research agenda. **Each of these will need to quite explicitly frame a spatial question and consider the kinds of maps and data that the spatial question will engage.** We are not asking you to develop full projects/courses in four days – but rather to create “prototypes” (a draft of the framing elements of your course or project). On Friday each group/pair will give a short presentation (7 min) about their assignments or research agenda, and the process of making it.

The goal here is to apply and test some of the concepts and methods you have learned in the course thus far to your group's topics, by creating an actual artifact (see below).

These group presentations will open onto a structured conversation about the kinds of new methodological and pedagogical approaches spatial thinking might allow, as well as the challenges often present when embarking on a mapping project on your own.

#### Prototype Requirements

The form of your prototype should speak to the concerns of your group's topic and clarify the spatial question(s) you are asking your students to answer. It must also include at least one map (static or web based).

If you are designing an assignment your prototype must include at least:  
* the description of your assignment (including; what is/are the spatial question(s) you are asking your students to answer?)
* the learning objectives for your assignment
* a brief note about the course the assignment contributes to
* data cleaned for your students (or a guide for where your students should go to seek out their own datasets)
* some draft maps that are examples of what you would like you students to produce

If you are designing a research project your prototype must include at least:
* an outline of a research methodology
* the spatial question(s) you hope to answer with this research
* some preliminary analytical or thematic maps
* a list of further data sets you need to find or produce
* a list of other maps you would like to produce

The requirements for these "prototypes" are a starting point and are purposefully broad. Feel free to move beyond them, drawing on the methods and concepts covered in course tutorials, the course bibliography, examples from the geohumanities as inspiration.


#### Presentations

If you are designing a course assignment some questions you might choose address in your presentation are:

* What is/are the spatial question(s) you are asking your students to answer?
* What are the learning objectives for an assignment aimed at answering those questions?
* What datasets will your students draw on to answer those questions?
* What methods will your students need to employ to answer those questions?
* What deliverables will you ask your students to produce?
* How will you assess student work and learning outcomes?

If you are designing a research project some questions you might choose address in your presentation are:
* What is your spatial research question?
* What datasets will you draw on to answer that question?
* What analytical methods will you need to use to address this question?
* What new methods will you need to learn?
* What will the final form of your research take?


#### Outline

On *Tuesday, May 30*: Revisit your research questions in light of the research you conducted on the availability of datasets. Decide with your group on a general direction for the "prototype."

Between Tuesday and Wednesday research examples/precedents that can help guide your group's work on the prototype.

On both *Wednesday* and *Thursday* you will have 1 hour to work with your group and the course instructors to develop your "prototype".

On *Friday, June 2* you will have 2.5 hours to work with your group and the course instructors to finalize your prototype and presentation. The final 2 hours of class will be dedicated to group presentations and a discussion of the work.
