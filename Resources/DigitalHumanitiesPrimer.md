Digital humanities, in its various branches, involves:
 
    - computer-assisted studies of large collections of texts, images, or music 
    - digitized archives and interactive digital tools for scholarship
    - studies of digital media by the humanistic disciplines.

These activities overlap with fields like the history of the book, library and information science, media studies, and computational social science in often very messy and contradictory ways.  So it's not possible to explore all of those branches here, but the following points of entry will aid those of you interested in digging further:

Overviews
--------------------

- Franco Moretti, *Graphs Maps Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History* (Verso, 2005): the one book to read in this domain, if you read just one. It is not explicitly “digital,” but it makes the most important argument for the kinds of literary-historical methods that now seem to require computers.
- [*Debates in the Digital Humanities*](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/) (University of Minnesota Press, 2013) and its sequel, *Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016*, edited by Matthew K. Gold an dLauren Klein: useful, large collections of short position papers.
- [*A Companion to Digital Humanities*](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/), ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, and John Unsworth (Blackwell, 2008):  This overview of humanities computing is dated but revealing about the history of DH.

Journals
--------------------

- recent special issues of several journals show how DH is entering general conversations: *Representations* vol. 127 no. 1 (on “search”) and *Modern Language Quarterly* vol. 77 no. 3 (on “scale and value”)
- [Stanford Literary Lab](http://litlab.stanford.edu/) pamphlets:  not a journal, but a series of essays, most authored or co-authored by graduate students, coming out of the department most strongly associated with quantitative approaches to literary study.
- [Journal of Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/): an open-access journal now on hiatus, whose previous issues are a useful resource that remain online
- [Digital Humanities Quarterly](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/): another open-access journal, in publication since 2007
- [Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh): formerly known as Literary and Linguistic Computing, an international, peer-reviewed journal in publication since 1986. Primarily addresses technical specialists
- [Journal of Cultural Analytics](http://culturalanalytics.org/): a new journal “dedicated to the computational study of culture”
    
User-friendly, introductory tools
----------------------

- [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/): lets you experiment with basic word-counting techniques in one or multiple texts (multiple texts are more interesting: you can compare distinctive words across texts, for example). Click “Open” and choose Shakespeare’s plays from the menu, or paste in your own texts.
- [Alan Liu's Toychest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244243/FrontPage): an enormous catalogue of tools, tutorials, and overviews curated by a senior scholar. Browsing there is an overwhelming experience, but Liu’s aim is to collect everything that is freely available and of potential interest for graduate and undergraduate humanities students, so there is much that might catch your eye.
- [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/): collection of tutorials specifically geared toward common applications in humanities scholarship: scraping a database for texts, etc.
- Google: if you're a beginner having a problem, someone else has already asked that question in the same exact way
